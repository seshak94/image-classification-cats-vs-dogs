# Image Classification (Cats vs Dogs)

This project builds a binary image classification model to distinguish between cats and dogs using supervised machine learning on raw pixel data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- PIL (for image handling)

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Converted RGB images into flat pixel arrays for training
- Implemented classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
- Achieved 65.5% accuracy using Random Forest
- Visualized model predictions and accuracy distribution

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pillow


2. Run image_classifier.ipynb or the corresponding .py script.
